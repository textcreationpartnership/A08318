THE NEVV GOSPEL, NOT THE TRVE GOSPEL OR, A diſcovery of the Life and Death, Doctrin, and Doings of M
#####Body#####

1. THE NEW GOSPEL, NOT THE TRVE GOSPEL.

    _ 1. ASSERTION. The Law is a Rule of the fleſh, and to walk after the Law, is to walk after the fleſh, Rom. 8.12.

    _ 2. ASSERTION. The Law is not to be preached, to beleevers, by Goſpell Miniſters.

    _ 3. ASSERTION. If repentance and faith bee wrought only by the Goſpell: then what doth the Law work in any mans converſion to God, or conformity to Chriſt.

    _ 4. ASSERTION. The law did once diſcover ſin, it doth ſo no more; nor yet for direction: love herein tranſcends the law, as far as life, doth death.

    _ 5. ASSERTION. The new covenant hath no condition at all: faith is not the condition of the Goſpels promiſes; but only a qualification in us.

    _ 6. ASSERTION. The Goſpel was in mans nature before the fall.

    _ 7. ASSERTION. Faith is not to be tryed, by any fruits, or effects, but only by the perſwaſion it ſelfe.

    _ 8. ASSERTION. Faith is the only ſigne of ſalvation.

    _ 9. ASSERTION. The new Creature, is only faith in Chriſt.

    _ 10. ASSERTION. Regeneration is not to bee tryed by any other fruits, effects, or ſignes, but only by faith, wherin it conſiſteth.

    _ 11. ASSERTION. Sanctification is not by the ſpirit in our ſelves, but only in Chriſt; ſhewed in acts, and not in the habits of grace.

    _ 12. ASSERTION. Beleevers, when they fall into any ſin, be it adultery or murther are not to mourne or grieve, (for that ſavours of the fleſh) but ſtill to rejoyce, becauſe it is written, rejoyce evermore; and that joy is the ſpeciall means to bring them out of their ſin.

    _ 13. ASSERTION. Careleſſe Chriſtians are the choiſeſt beleevers, becauſe they depend wholly upon Chriſt.

    _ 14. ASSERTION. To doubt of the favour of God, after ſinne committed, is worſe than the ſin it ſelfe.

    _ 15. ASSERTION. It is as eaſie to beleeve remiſſion of ſins, as to make confeſſion of them.

    _ 16. ASSERTION. Chriſt is involved in every proverb of Salomon.

    _ 17. ASSERTION. The 15. Pſal. is only a deſcription of Chriſt: and the beatitudes, Mat. 5. only belong to him; and to no man, that ever was or ſhall be, becauſe all men are vanitie.

    _ 18. ASSERTION. The ſaying of Salomon; Rejoyce in the wife of thy youth, is not meant of a mans wife, but of Chriſt; becauſe he can ſatisfie us at all times.

    _ 19. ASSERTION. It is too great preſumption for any Miniſter, to undertake the expoſition of any whole book in the Scriptures, becauſe he cannot ſhew how Chriſt is involved in every part.

    _ 20. ASSERTION. Every true beleever (howſoever it ſeemes) doth alwayes grow in faith and love, and anſwerable fruits.

    _ 21. ASSERTION. No man can ſay, he doth love his brother, till he hath laid downe his life for him: neither can we our ſelves ſay, wee love the brethren, but we may ſay of others, that they doe. So expounding, 1. Iohn 3.14.

    _ Concerning the five Cautions.

    _ Of his Rule of faith.

1. ¶ A Short Advertiſement concerning Mr. RICE BOYE, as a Paralell to the former.
